### Set up Python App 

**Install Python and Pip:**
**Update Your System**:
- Open a terminal and update your package manager:
```
sudo yum update -y
```

**Check for Pre-installed Python Versions**:
- Check which versions of Python are already installed:
```
python --version
python3 --version
```

**Install Python 3.x** (if a different version of Python 3 is needed):
- Amazon Linux 2 has Python 3 available in its repositories. You can install it directly:
```
sudo yum install python3 -y
```

**Verify Python Installation**:
- After installation, verify the Python version:
```
python3 --version
```

**Install Pip on Amazon Linux**
Pip is included by default when you install Python 3 from Amazon Linuxâ€™s repository. If for some reason it's not installed, you can install it using:
```
sudo yum install python3-pip -y
```

**Verify Pip Installation**:
- Check the installed Pip version:
```
pip3 --version
```

**Upgrade Pip** (Optional):
- Upgrade Pip to the latest version:
```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

**Create a Python Application**:
- You can create a simple Python application using Flask and `prometheus_flask_exporter` to expose metrics.
- Install Flask and `prometheus_flask_exporter`:
```
pip3 install Flask prometheus_flask_exporter
```

**Create a Python Application with Custom Metrics**
 - Create Your Python Application (`app.py`):
 - This application will have two endpoints and two custom metrics: a counter and a gauge.

```
from flask import Flask
from prometheus_flask_exporter import PrometheusMetrics
from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge

app = Flask(__name__)
metrics = PrometheusMetrics(app)

# Custom metric - Counter
visit_counter = Counter(
    'page_visits', 'Number of visits to the page', ['endpoint']
)

# Custom metric - Gauge
inventory_gauge = Gauge(
    'inventory', 'Current inventory level', ['item']
)

# Initialize inventory for demonstration
inventory = {
    'item1': 5,
    'item2': 10
}

@app.route('/')
def main():
    visit_counter.labels(endpoint='/').inc()  # Increment counter
    return "Welcome to the Python app with Prometheus metrics!"

@app.route('/visit-item1')
def visit_item1():
    visit_counter.labels(endpoint='/visit-item1').inc()  # Increment counter
    inventory['item1'] -= 1  # Simulate an inventory change
    inventory_gauge.labels(item='item1').set(inventory['item1'])  # Update gauge
    return f"Visited item1. Inventory: {inventory['item1']}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

**Run the Application**:
Execute the script to start your Flask application:
```
python3 app.py
```

This application now exposes two custom metrics:

- `page_visits`: A counter that increases every time either the main page or the `/visit-item1` endpoint is visited.
- `inventory`: A gauge that reflects the current level of inventory for `item1`, which decreases every time `/visit-item1` is visited.

**Ensure Prometheus is Configured to Scrape Metrics**
On your Prometheus server (VM1), make sure you have the following job in your `prometheus.yml`:

```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'python_app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['[Instance 2 IP or DNS]:5000']
```

**Interact with Your Application and Observe Metrics**

**Access Your Python Application**: Visit the main page and `/visit-item1` endpoint of your Flask application through a web browser or using a tool like `curl`.
    
**View Metrics in Prometheus**: Go to your Prometheus UI (`http://[Instance 1 IP or DNS]:9090`) and use the metrics explorer to view `page_visits` and `inventory` metrics.

By following these steps, your Python application will not only expose default metrics from `prometheus_flask_exporter` but also custom metrics that you define, which Prometheus can then scrape and monitor.

Next, I will demonstrate pushing metrics from short lived job in VM2 to Pushgateway in VM1.
